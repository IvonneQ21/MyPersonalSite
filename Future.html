<p>  For the past year I’ve been contemplating changing career, and now I’m super excited to begin that path at Galvanize. This is just the beginning of my journey to learn the latest and most useful technologies. After competing Galvanize school, I will continue to learn and grow towards combining my bilingual skills, my passion for genetics, and all the knowledge acquired here to become an important contributor to the development team. I would  also like to one day develop applications that will be useful to collaborate between parents and teachers.
